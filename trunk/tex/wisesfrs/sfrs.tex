We begin by selecting all galaxies in the SDSS/VAGC DR72 that overlap
the footprint of WISE observations released as part of their first
data release.  Maybe give the Galactic longitude limits?  [All
  magnitude limits are corrected for Galactic extinction using the
  \citet{schlegel98a} dust maps and the \citet{cardelli89a} Milky Way
  extinction law assuming $R_{V}=3.1$.]  The SDSS sample has $ugriz$
imaging and $3700-9200$~\AA{} spectrophotometry from the SDSS and is
flux-limited with $14.5<r<17.6$ and $0.01<z<0.25$.  Note that the
redshift cuts are very soft; roughly $98.9\%$ of the parent sample are
within these limits.  The parent sample has $521,604$ galaxies, of
which $200,862$ ($39\%$) are in the WISE footprint.  Next, we restrict
our sample to objects with MIS-depth GALEX imaging, i.e., FUV and NUV
exposure times $>1000$~s, leaving $48,694$ ($24\%$) galaxies.  We
require (Galactic extinction corrected) $\fuv=\nuv<23$ to ensure good
GALEX photometry.  Brighter than this limit GALEX is more than $80\%$
complete, while at fainter flux levels source confusion starts to
become important (wyder, schiminovich).  At the flux limit of our SDSS
sample objects with $\nuv-r>5.4$ will be excluded from our sample;
however, all of these should be passively evolving and would have to
have pathological amounts of dust extinction to be that red (calculate
how much!).  Our UV flux cuts leave $25,968$ ($74\%$) galaxies.

Next we apply flux cuts at $22$~\micron, which we need in order to be
able to estimate the infrared luminosities of the galaxies in our
sample.  In DR1 WISE is flux-limited above $6$~mJy ($5\sigma$), over
the whole survey region, and to fainter flux levels in areas with more
overlapping coverage \citep{wright10a}.  Therefore, we restrict our
sample to have $[22]<14.45$, including upper limits.  Need to talk
about which fluxes we use - profile, aperture, 2mass, etc.
